### Hello, I'm Jesse Powell

## I like data, I like text, and I love to learn about programming.
- I currently do Digital Humanities work at Florida State University, where I apply statistics and computing in humanities research.
- I have used machine learning and data mining techniques to work on projects concerning the history of biology, Haitian literature and history, monsters in literature, philosophy, and more!
- Currently trying to create an R package for digital humanities.
- Currently learning as much as I can about functional programming, statistics and machine learning.

### Languages and Tools:
